# Chess Puzzle Visualizer
Configure the board and get a quick visualization of which squares are under the most pressure. Train pattern recognition to quickly spot the critical winning moves. This isn't intended to be a means to actually play chess, just to visualize the current state of board pressure.

## WIP
- [ ] Knight movements

## Future Additions
- [ ] Invalid moves/check detection
- [ ] Improved visualization arrows for general board pressure instead of focusing only on captures/defenses
- [ ] X-ray attacks/defenses to help spot aggressive captures or hidden defenders
- [ ] Board configurability
